This project is now written in python, because it is pythonic to not have interdependence between classes when it is unneccessary, and interdependence was basically the bane of the java version.

===Old Readme===
This project is written in Java. To view the code, open src/
For downloads, open jars/
To compile, use javac src/*.java

The idea of this project is to create a sort of a "game" with traffic simulation.
The point that will make it different from other games is that it will allow users to define their own rules for traffic lights to follow.
The traffic lights will use JavaScript. (hence the name of the repo).
