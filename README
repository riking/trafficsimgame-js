This project is now written in python, because the interdependencies
were becoming a clusterfuck, and in python it is good practice to not have
interdependence between classes when it is unneccessary.
(aka it'll put me in a better coding viewpoint)

===Old Readme===
This project is written in Java. To view the code, open src/
For downloads, open jars/
To compile, use javac src/*.java

The idea of this project is to create a sort of a "game" with traffic simulation.
The point that will make it different from other games is that it will allow users to define their own rules for traffic lights to follow.
The traffic lights will use JavaScript. (hence the name of the repo).
